# CSS calc() Function Errors
This repository demonstrates common errors and their solutions when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `calc()` function, while powerful, can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  This example highlights issues with unit handling, operator precedence, and nested expressions.  The solution file provides corrected code demonstrating how to avoid these pitfalls.

**Common Errors:**
* **Incorrect Unit Handling:** Forgetting to include units (e.g., `px`, `%`, `em`) or using inconsistent units within the calculation.
* **Operator Precedence Issues:** Misunderstanding the order of operations and the impact on the calculation result.
* **Nested `calc()` Expressions:** Improperly nesting `calc()` expressions, leading to parsing errors or unintended outcomes.

**Solutions:**
* **Consistent Units:** Ensure all values within a `calc()` expression use compatible and consistently specified units.
* **Use Parentheses:** For complex expressions, use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations.
* **Careful Nesting:** Avoid excessively deep nesting of `calc()` expressions, opting for simpler calculations if possible.
