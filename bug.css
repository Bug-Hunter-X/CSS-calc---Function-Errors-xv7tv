The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on different CSS values, but it can lead to unexpected results when dealing with units and precedence. For instance, if you try to calculate a width based on percentages and pixels without careful consideration of operator precedence, you might get an unexpected result. Another common error is forgetting to specify the units correctly in each value involved in a `calc()` expression. For example, omitting units can lead to calculations that produce unintended outputs or simply do not work.  Incorrect nesting of `calc()` within other `calc()` expressions can also lead to parsing errors or incorrect results.
